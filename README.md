# Flutter Door Control (WIP)

A cross-platform app for interacting with an MQTT device

## Functionality
- Using web sockets and MQTT, send 'lock' and 'unlock' commands to the free MQTT Broker cloudmqtt.com.
- This commands will be read by an Mbed K64-F microcontroller in order to move a servo attached to the lock on my bedroom door. Currently on hold due to moving house as uni has finished, however I did get this working with a simple webserver and HTML page (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B7rv9F7gnNllrKlZ0lMVs8UnPkS7e9UR)
